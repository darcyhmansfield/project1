# Project 1 - Suplex Slam

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have a wrestling fantasy league? Well wonder no longer, because Suplex Slam Fantasy League is here to blow your (hopefully very low) expectations out of the water.

[Link]() to the website coming soon!

## About

This project started as a demonstration of building a basic CRUD system within the Rails environment. Four models were designed at the beginning - Users, Teams, Wrestlers and Promotions. The relationships between the models are outlined below:

* One user can have many teams (one-to-many).
* Teams can have many wrestlers and wrestlers can be in many teams (many-to-many).
* Promotions can have many wrestlers (one-to-many)

The website also showcases basic Bootstrap styling.

## How To Use

1. Create account
2. Look through the whopping 14 wrestlers available (hopefully will update with more in the future) and choose your perfect team of three.
3. Dominate

## Snapshot

## Roadmap

* Add functionality to the 'Create Team' link once logged in
* Add further wrestlers
* Create scoring system for teams

## Acknowledgements

An absolutely huge hug goes out to Joel, CJ, Mark, Tina and all my classmates for helping me out during this project.
